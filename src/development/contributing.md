# Contributing

Stateless Ethereum is an open-source initiative pushing the boundaries of Ethereum scalability and usability. We welcome contributors from all backgroundsâ€”whether you're a blockchain researcher, cryptography expert, protocol developer, or just passionate about decentralized technology.

## How to Get Involved

* **Help with the documentation**
  * Read this book and create a pull request to add any information you think is missing.
* **Join the Discussion**
  * Comment on our EIPâ€™s ethereum magicians threads [EIP-6800](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/proposed-verkle-tree-scheme-for-ethereum-state/5805), [EIP4762](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-4762-statelessness-gas-cost-changes/8714), [EIP7612](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/ethereum-state-trie-format-change-using-an-overlay/4165), [EIP7748](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7748-state-conversion-to-verkle-tree/20625), [EIP7736](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7736-leaf-level-state-expiry-in-verkle-trees/20474/2), [EIP7864](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7864-ethereum-state-using-a-unified-binary-tree/22611).
  * Join the Stateless implementersâ€™ Call to discuss progress and ideas.
* **Use our devnets**
  * Deploy your contracts on the devnet.
  * Run your own node.
* **Pick an issue in one of our [repositories](https://github.com/stateless-consensus)**
  * Look for issues labeled **"Good First Issue"** or **"Help Wanted"** in our GitHub.
  * If you're unsure where to start, open a discussionâ€”weâ€™d love to help!
* **Implement our specs in various clients**
  * Not all clients implement all features, so check for issues in their repositories with the `verkle` or `stateless` tags/branches.
  * Submit a pull request (PR) and request a review from the maintainers.
* **Review & Improve**
  * Review open PRs, suggest improvements, and help refine the implementation.
  * Contribute to documentation and educational resources.
* **Review our [use cases](../use-cases/intro.md) or add your own**
  * Look at the list of our use cases and give us some feedback.
  * Build your own demos and share them with us.
* **Help spread the gospel of stateless**
  * Share our [talks and articles](../resources.md).
  * Create some learning resources of your own!

Every contributionâ€”big or smallâ€”helps bring stateless Ethereum closer to reality. ðŸš€
